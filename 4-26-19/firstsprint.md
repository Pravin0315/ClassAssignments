# First Project Retrospective

## Places I excelled:
I believe I may have learned some things about myself during this project and what I potentially want to do as a career. I was able to lead the team and keep motiviation up during times when the group was getting discouraged or frustrated due to a certain issue. This leads me to think that maybe project management could be a potential route for me to pursue. I would have to do more research into project management responsibilities and information to be sure this wasn't just a temporary feeling.

## Areas to improve:
I am still struggling to get a gasp on getting a problem and getting my mind to start processing how to begin coding it out. I could use some more examples with an emphasis on how I would start the coding process and what certain methods I would use. I hate feeling like a liability to my team when they were are all much more skilled at coding than I am. I tried to read through the files after it had been submitted to the Git repository to try to gain a better understanding but I couldn't put everything together as to the why certain methods were being used.
